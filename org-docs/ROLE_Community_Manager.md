# Steering Committee Role: Community Manager

The Community Manager is one of the Steering Committee (SC) positions. 

It can be challenging doing this type of role as volunteer, therefore it can be split between two people if desired. If split between two people on the SC, ensure that tasks are clearly allocated, and highlight which ones are essential and which are aspirational. Essential tasks should cover sections in the [organisational charter](CHARTER.md) (see 3.3, 3.6, 4.3 and 8) for example organising and chairing SC meetings, and facilitating communication across community members in general. Aspirational tasks will likely reflect ideas about how to grow the community, including how to make it more accessible and more sustainable.

## Current Community Manager(s)

Rachael Stickland and Mary Miedema

## Current role definition 

Role definition co-designed by Mary and Rachael. The aspirational tasks (A) reflect interests/skills of Mary and Rachael so new community managers may want to edit/add. The essential tasks (E) are likely to be more consistent across community managers.

It is important to note that other SC members (and community members where appropriate) can contribute to the tasks below - it is the community manager's role to try to see they get done and keep the community on track.
