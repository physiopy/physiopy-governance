# Charter for the Physiopy Organization

This is the organizational charter for the *physiopy* Organization (the "Organization"). By adding their name to the [Steering Committee file](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) or [Advisory Council file](./ADVISORY-COUNCIL.md) members agree as follows.

## 1. Mission

The Organization has five aims:

1. Raise awareness of best practices for physiological data collection and analysis in neuroimaging.
2. Create, maintain, and share toolboxes and documentation following open science and open-source software best practices in support of the collection, usage, and sharing of physiological data.
3. Maintain a set of community guidelines for topics related to physiological data, based on community consensus.
4. Sustain an accessible ecosystem of governance where end users can interact with community activities and outcomes.
5. Promote data standards for physiological measurements and their derivatives, striving towards minimum standards to be recognized and adopted by the wider community.

## 2. Organizational bodies

The Organization is represented by its members, organized in the following bodies:

1. The Community, composed of all active community members and project contributors.
2. The Steering Committee, whose aim is to guide and organize the operations of the Organization at large.
3. The Advisory Council, whose aim is to council the Steering Committee and offer suggestions on the Organization’s activities.

## 3. Steering Committee

**3.1 Purpose**. The Steering Committee will be responsible for all technical oversight, project approval and oversight, policy oversight, and trademark management for the Organization. These responsibilities include tasks like:

- Endorsing applications to grants, prizes, and scholarships 
- Starting a new project, accepting a donated repository, closing a project
- Setting goals for the years and deadlines for project development
- Approving the main focus of community efforts, in collaboration with the community and the Advisory Council
- Approving changes to software development
- Supporting the development of the community
- Ensuring that participation in the Organization is accessible to newcomers and that they have access to the Organization’s on-boarding materials 
- Promoting the Code of Conduct and the Organization governance, and responding to violations of these documents

**3.2 Minimum expectations**. Members of the steering committee are expected at minimum to:

- Understand and agree with the code of conduct, the contributors guidelines, and the governance of the Organization, and promote them across the Organization
- Understand the goals and priorities of the Organization and promote them
- Be actively involved in a project
- Be reachable [see 6.2] and attend steering committee meetings

**3.3 Composition**. The Steering Committee voting members are listed in the steering-committee.md file in the repository. The Steering Committee will appoint a Community Manager responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity. The following seats are to be filled on the Steering Committee:

- 2 representatives involved in code and libraries development projects
- 2 representatives involved in Community Practices and other documentation-based projects 
- 1 representative involved in each transient project 
- 1 member in a Learning Seat position, encouraged to shadow and support other representatives, particularly the Community Manager
- 1 Community Manager, responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity and managing collaboration and communication between the Steering Committee and the community, whether that be active community members or wider stakeholders.

**3.4 Term.** Each seat has a suggested term length of 1-3 years. Nomination to and ratification of Steering Committee membership shall proceed following the decision-making processes detailed in 3.5 & 3.6. 

**3.5. Decision Making**. All decisions should involve the community at large whenever possible, with the Steering Committee ratifying the community decision. Through discussion and negotiation, the Steering Committee will strive for all its decisions to be made by consensus (everyone supports, or no individual strongly opposes, a course of action). While explicit agreement of the entire Steering Committee is preferred, it is not required. Rather, the Steering Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee, nature of support and objections, and their knowledge of community views. The Steering Committee will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. If a decision cannot be reached by this consensus method, a voting method can be used instead.

**3.6. Voting**. Voting is a method of decision making, but is not mandatory, except in cases when the structure or mission of the Organization is amended, as defined by this Organization charter. The Community Manager will call a vote with reasonable notice of at least three days to the Steering Committee, setting out a discussion period of maximum a week and a separate voting period of two days. Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. The discussion will be open to the public. In any vote, each SC member will have one vote. Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote require a simple majority vote of all voting members. If, and only if, a split vote is reached, the Community Manager will have a casting vote.

## 4. Relationship of the Steering Committee to the Community

**4.1 Community Involvement in Decisions**. It is a core principle of the Organization that decisions should consider the perspectives of all stakeholders in the Organization and its projects. Whenever relevant and timely, decision making by the Steering Committee should seek to involve the Community with an open discussion and collection of Community opinions, e.g., by a vote open to all active Community members. In such cases, the open vote will follow the regulations described in section 3.5.

**4.2 Accountability of the Steering Committee to the Community**. Any community member has the right to bring an issue or idea to the Steering Committee for discussion. The Steering Committee is responsible for providing channels of communication to facilitate this process.

**4.3 On-Boarding of Newcomers to the Community**. The Community Manager of the Steering Committee shall take an active role in ensuring that newcomers to the Organization have access to general on-boarding materials for the Organization and are introduced to contacts within Projects, according to their interest.

**4.4 Code of Conduct Enforcement**. The Steering Committee is responsible for promoting behavior in accordance with the Code of Conduct within the Organization. Where a violation of the Code of Conduct may be brought to the attention of the Steering Committee, the Steering Committee shall decide on an appropriate course of action.

## 5. Advisory Council

**5.1 Purpose**. The Advisory Council purpose is to provide guidance and council to the Steering Committee and the community at large, on matters including, but not limited to:

- Applications to grants, prizes, and scholarships
- Short-term and long-term aims and goals of the Organization
- Staying up to date with community trends, informing the Organization of other  organizations/initiatives which share common goals and activities

Additionally, the Advisory Council may be called to mediate or judge a violation of the code of conduct and of the Organizational governance, if this violation relates to an individual on the Steering Committee. 

**5.2 Minimum expectations**. Members of the Advisory Council are expected at minimum to:
- Understand and agree with the code of conduct, the contributors guidelines, and the governance of the Organization
- Help formulating a suggestion when asked.
- Meet at least once a year to provide an annual suggestion to the Steering Committee and to nominate two Chairs when necessary.

**5.3 Composition**. There is no limit to the number of members of the Advisory Council. Members of the Advisory Council are people that stand in high esteem to the community, generally having either a senior position in academic or industrial institutions, having been a founding member of the Organization, having been significant and/or long term active members of the community, or of other open science or open source projects. The Steering Committee is in charge of nominating new Advisory Council members. Past Steering Committee members are automatically nominated to join the Advisory Council.

**5.4 Chairs**. The Advisory Council has two co-chairs, elected by the Advisory Council at large. The two chairs are in charge of organizing the annual Advisory Council meeting, as well as any other meeting, when necessary, and to coordinate the written communication of suggestions to the Steering Committee at least annually or upon their request.

**5.4 Term**. There is no limit to the term of an Advisory Council member. The two chairs have a term limit of 3 years. However, if a member of the Advisory Council becomes a member of the Steering Committee, their Advisory Council membership shall be paused until the end of their Steering Committee term.

## 6. Violations of governance terms and termination of Membership

**6.1. Violations**. In case a member or a contributor of the Community is reported to have breached Code of Conduct or Governance, the Steering Committee shall investigate. If the breach of the violation is confirmed by the Steering Committee, they will decide on an appropriate course of action, ranging from a warning to the member in question to their temporary or permanent ban from the Community. If a violation relates to a Steering Committee member, the Advisory Council will be included in these investigations and decisions.

**6.2. Membership termination**. Additionally to the term limits indicated above, membership of the Steering Committee and of the Advisory Council will terminate if any of the following occur:
- **Violation of code of conduct, contributors guidelines, or governance terms**. If a member of the Steering Committee or the Advisory Council committed a serious violation of code of conduct, contributors guidelines, or governance terms, the [Steering Committee/Advisory Council] may decide to terminate their membership of the relevant body.
- **Resignation**. Written notice of resignation to the relevant body.
- **Unreachable Member**. If a member is unresponsive at its listed handle for more than six months for the Steering Committee and more than two years for the Advisory Council, the Steering Committee may vote to remove such members from either bodies.
